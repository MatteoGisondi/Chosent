# Chosen't
A game where you're the one who *wasn't* Chosen.

In this 2D top-down tower defense -esque game, inspired by the tabletop game Boss Monsters, you play as the traditional enemy: The Chosen't. Your goal is to send your hoards of minions to defeat the Chosen before he reaches you at the end of the maze.

This game was created during the **ConUHacks VII Hackathon** at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
